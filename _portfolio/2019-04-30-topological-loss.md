While many deep learning based frameworks are proposed to solve the delineation problem in images, the global topology can not be guarenteed in most cases. The authors designed a topology-aware U-Net in the paper: [Beyond the Pixel-Wise Loss for Topology-Aware Delineation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Mosinska_Beyond_the_Pixel-Wise_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf).

In this paper, we achieved the following goals:

* Implemented the algorithm in PyTorch

* Reproduced the results on [Massachusetts Roads Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/)

## Requirements

* PyTorch 1.0
* \>= Python 3
* Visdom
