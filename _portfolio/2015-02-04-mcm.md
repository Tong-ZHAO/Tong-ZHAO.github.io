In Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) 2015, we chose the problem A. In this problem, we are required to build a mathematical model to describe the process of curbing Ebola, which includes critical factors such as the spread of disease and the distribution of medicine. 

Based on famous [SEIR](https://me.ucsb.edu/~moehlis/APC514/tutorials/tutorial_seasonal/node4.html) model, we build an epidemic region model taking into account the “contact-infection” principle and the variance of resistance among individuals. The refined version also considers the social circle of a person. Simulation results are compared with true data in two African countries to verify its correctness.

## Implementation

* C++    : Basic model
* Python : Refined model
