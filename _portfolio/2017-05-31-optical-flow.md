Optical flow (or optic flow) is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene. The aim of this project is to present traditional optical flow algorithms to our class. 

In this project, we focus on its following points:

* Modeling

* Calculation

  - Lucas-Kanade Method

  - Horn-Schunck Method

* Application
