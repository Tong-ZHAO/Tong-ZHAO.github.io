Bilateral filter is a widely used smoothing operator which preserves boundaries in an image. To deal with more complicated tasks, [Fast Bilateral Solver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf) is proposed to perform an optimization in bilateral space.

In this project, we achieved the following goals:

* Implemented the algorithm in Python

* Applied it into stereo problem and colorization problem

* Studied the influence of different parameters

## Requirement

* \>= Python 3
* Scipy, Skimage, Matplotlib

## Source Code
