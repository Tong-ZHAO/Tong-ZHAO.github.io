The underlying topic of this project is the reconstruction of a 3D object from a single RGB image. Specifically we work on a recent deep learning framework - [Pixel2Mesh](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Nanyang_Wang_Pixel2Mesh_Generating_3D_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf). Given a 2D picture of an object, it is able to compute a 3D mesh representation after several deformations of an original ellipsoid mesh.

In this project, we achieved the following goals:

* Implement Pixel2Mesh in PyTorch
* Replace the VGG model by a U-Net based autoencoder to reconstruct the image, which helps the net to converge faster
* Numerical analysis

## Requirements

* PyTorch 1.0 (Enable Sparse Tensor)
* \>= Python 3
* \>= Cuda 9.2 (Enable Chamfer Distance)
* Visdom (Enable Data Visualization)

## Source Code
